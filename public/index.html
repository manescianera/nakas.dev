        <h1 class="heading">Hi, I'm <span class="red">Å½ygimantas</span>.</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                I am a <b class="red">software engineer</b> from Vilnius,
                Lithuania. Currently, I focus on data handling, AI integrations,
                and prompt engineering. Additionally I am well-versed in cloud
                infrastructure and web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working at
                <a href="https://tables.dev/" target="_blank"
                    >External Tables</a
                >
                as a data engineer.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                One day in 2019 I've thought of a career change from a very
                unrelated field. At the time I didn't know much about
                programming but I've thought that it might fit me.
            </p>

            <p>
                Firstly I've started as a digital marketing specialist in a
                company that builds various digital products and promotes
                freedom of personal improvement. Given the company culture and
                unorthodox specifics of our team somehow I've started building
                websites and webscraping.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fast forward a year and somehow I've got okay in Go and received
                my first freelance job. Some jobs later and I'm offered a real
                job as a software engineer. During this time I've got to work
                with many different technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially it felt like being dropped in the middle of the ocean
                so it was either swim or drown. Somehow I've managed to keep my
                head dry and now I couldn't be happier with the choice to change
                career.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="heading">What floats my boat?</h2>
            <h4 class="heading">Languages</h4>
            <p>
                I've worked with a variety of languages. My favorite for a
                several years is
                <b class="red">Go</b>, although lately at work I'm mostly using
                <b class="red">Python</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I've started my career as a web developer obviously I've
                used <span class="red">JavaScript</span> and some
                <span class="red">PHP</span> (specifically
                <span class="red">Laravel</span>). I've also fiddled around with
                <span class="red">Vue</span> and
                <span class="red">Svelte</span> on the front-end. Might be a bit
                rusty with those but muscle memory is still there.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also had a <i>pleasure</i> to work with
                <span class="red">Java</span>. Wouldn't say that I'd like to
                repeat that but it was a good learning experience.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading">Data</h4>
            <p>
                As as data engineer I'm mostly working with vast amounts of data
                serving multiple clients. Here <b class="red">Snowflake</b> is
                our go-to data platform. I'm versed with most of its features
                including <i>Snowpark Container Services</i> and
                <i>Native App Framework</i> for application deployment.
            </p>

            <p>
                For testing or some smaller projects I prefer
                <b class="red">PostgreSQL</b>. The first database I've ever used
                was <span class="red">MySQL</span> but I've worked with it only
                briefly.
            </p>

            <p>
                For data transformation I'm using <b class="red">dbt</b>. I
                think that no other tool have yet came close to its simplicity
                and power. Of course I've also had my fair share of Python
                libraries like <b class="red">pandas</b> and
                <b class="red">numpy</b>.
            </p>

            <h4 class="heading">Infrastructure</h4>
            <p>
                Since I've started my career during cloud infrastructure boom
                this is mostly what I've used for deployment.
                <b class="red">AWS</b> is my preferred platform for cloud
                infrastructure. While I'm not an expert of it I've never had any
                issue with picking up a new AWS feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="red">Docker</b> is obviously one of the most important
                tools for modern software development and I couldn't imagine my
                job without it. I think most of the projects I've worked on
                (both professional and personal) have used Docker in some way.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the size of the project grows it gets harder to manage its
                components. Because of that I firmly believe that
                infrastructure-as-code is the way to go. I've used
                <b class="red">Terraform</b> to manage both cloud and data
                infrastructure (AWS, Snowflake).
            </p>
