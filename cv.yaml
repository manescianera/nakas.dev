      During the pandemic I had a bit more time which I decided to use to diversify 
      my skills and get better at software development. I've worked on various projects 
      from triangular arbitrage calculations for cryptocurrencies to web scraping and
      data processing. Vast majority of my work was done in Go or Python. This is where
      I've learned communicating with customers and building software that is easy to use
      and understand.

      As strange as it sounds looking at the job title - this is the point in my career where
      software development started to become something more than a hobby. While I've worked on
      various issues related to digital marketing, due to the format of our team I was a "go to"
      person for all the things related to tech. These included writting blog posts about various
      technologies, creating custom tools for our team, or even websites depending on marketing
      needs. This is where I had a chance to learn about web development and use tools like Go and
      Python.

      - Digital Marketing
      - Interteam Communication
      - Web Development
